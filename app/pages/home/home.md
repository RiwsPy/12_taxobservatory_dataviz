Multinationals under the spotlight
{: .world_map_title .mt4 .mb3 }

This platform provides unprecedented insights into  how large corporations approach taxes across borders. Explore 
country-by-country financial reports published by multinationals to see where they declare profits and revenues, 
identify potential uses of tax havens or loopholes and analyze tax payments versus actual operations.<br/><br/>
While some multinationals now publish detailed country data, the reports remain scattered and difficult to analyze 
collectively. Our tool compiles this information into an accessible, user-friendly format. Start exploring the tax 
footprints of major multinationals today and unlock key insights into an often opaque aspect of global business.

European banks love tax havens
{: .blue_card_title .mb1 .pr2}

Analysing 7 years of country-by-country data published by European banks, we show that EU banks have been consistently 
present in tax havens with around 14% of their profits booked in tax havens annually. Implementing a 15% minimum tax 
rate could generate EUR 3-5 billion annually for European countries.

Tracking CbCR's Fragmented Uptake
{: .blue_card_title .mb1 .pr2}

Overall CbCR publishing rates are low (97 reports for 2020), but increasing rapidly. CbCR publishing is concentrated in 
European countries and in the extractive sector. Last, there remains significant room for progress on the completion of 
the information provided and the accessibility of these reports: 55% of the reports do not include all the recommended 
variables and reports are published in a wide variety of documents.
