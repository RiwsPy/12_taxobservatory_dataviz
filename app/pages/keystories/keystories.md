The rise of multinational enterprises (MNEs) as dominant players in the global economy has been accompanied by a 
concerning trend of tax avoidance strategies. With revenues of the 100 largest MNEs in 2021 equivalent to the combined 
GDP of economic powerhouses like Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, the scale of their operations is staggering. 
However, this economic might has also enabled sophisticated profit-shifting practices to minimize tax liabilities.
<br/><br/>
Estimates reveal a staggering $1 trillion in profits shifted to tax havens by MNEs in 2022 alone, amounting to a 
substantial 35 % of all foreign profits booked by these corporations. This persistent tax avoidance has led to a 
significant erosion of corporate tax revenues, with governments globally losing nearly 10 % of their potential 
corporate tax collections. The impact is particularly severe for European Union member states while developing 
countries face disproportionate welfare implications due to their higher reliance on corporate tax proceeds for 
essential public spending.
<br/><br/>
Despite concerted efforts by policymakers, such as the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative in 
2015 and the United States' legislative measures in 2017, the scale of global profit shifting has remained largely 
unabated. U.S. multinationals, responsible for approximately 40 % of the total, continue to shift nearly half of their 
foreign profits to low-tax jurisdictions, while their non-U.S. counterparts maintain a rate of around 30 % .
