The rise of multinational enterprises (MNEs) as dominant players in the global economy has been accompanied by a 
concerning trend of tax avoidance strategies. With revenues of the 100 largest MNEs in 2021 equivalent to the combined 
GDP of economic powerhouses like Germany, France, Italy, and Spain, the scale of their operations is staggering. 
However, this economic might has also enabled sophisticated profit-shifting practices to minimize tax liabilities.
<br/><br/>
Estimates reveal a staggering $1 trillion in profits shifted to tax havens by MNEs in 2022 alone, amounting to a 
substantial 35 % of all foreign profits booked by these corporations. This persistent tax avoidance has led to a 
significant erosion of corporate tax revenues, with governments globally losing nearly 10 % of their potential 
corporate tax collections. The impact is particularly severe for European Union member states while developing 
countries face disproportionate welfare implications due to their higher reliance on corporate tax proceeds for 
essential public spending.
<br/><br/>
Despite concerted efforts by policymakers, such as the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative in 
2015 and the United States' legislative measures in 2017, the scale of global profit shifting has remained largely 
unabated. U.S. multinationals, responsible for approximately 40 % of the total, continue to shift nearly half of their 
foreign profits to low-tax jurisdictions, while their non-U.S. counterparts maintain a rate of around 30 % .

**The voluntary publication of public country-by-country reports (CbCRs) by multinational enterprises (MNEs) has been on 
an upward trajectory in recent years.** However, the number of MNEs embracing this level of tax transparency remains 
remarkably low. Out of the thousands of large MNEs globally, **only 153 have published public CbCR data at least once as 
of 2021, representing less than 2% of all large MNEs worldwide.**
<br/><br/>
The MNEs that do publish public CbCRs tend to be some of the largest corporations. About 83% of the publishing MNEs 
have global revenues exceeding &#8364;750 million, the threshold commonly used to define a "large" MNE. A handful of energy 
giants like Shell, BP, and Total Energies lead the pack as some of the highest revenue publishers. However, the 
publishing MNEs collectively account for less than 5% of total global MNE revenues, underscoring how limited public 
CbCR disclosures are currently.
<br/><br/>
There are stark regional disparities in public CbCR publishing trends. European MNEs, particularly from Italy, Spain, 
Norway, and the UK, are leading the charge, with some countries seeing around 15-20% of their large MNEs publishing. 
In contrast, the United States, China, and several major tax havens have virtually no MNEs publishing public CbCRs, 
representing significant transparency gaps given their roles in the global economy.
